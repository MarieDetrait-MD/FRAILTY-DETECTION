Introduction

The QualiFHIR project, initiated by the Grand Hôpital de Charleroi, aims to enhance the management of care for geriatric patients by implementing an infrastructure based on the FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standard. This FHIR infrastructure enables the secure sharing of medical information among the partner hospitals of the project (Clinique Notre Dame de Grâce de Gosselies and CH de Mouscron) and supports the implementation of clinical decision support algorithms for detecting geriatric frailty.

FHIR Infrastructure

The established infrastructure is based on creating an interoperable data platform compatible with FHIR standards. Medical and socio-economic data are captured through questionnaires integrated into the Electronic Health Record (EHR) and processed using the standardized Snomed CT terminology. A FHIR repository has been developed for each hospital to store this data, facilitating its sharing among the project's partner hospitals. This infrastructure also serves as the foundation for training AI models. The project also includes a natural language processing (NLP) component to handle unstructured data.

Results

The developed algorithms, particularly XGBoost and an artificial neural network (ANN), have shown promising performance in detecting geriatric frailty. The XGBoost model achieved a ROC-AUC score of 0.875 and an accuracy of 0.92, while the ANN reached a ROC-AUC of 0.97 with an accuracy of 0.96. A LIME model was developed to correctly interpret the ANN. These initial results on a small cohort of patients (n=120) are encouraging as they indicate a reliable predictive capability. The same applies to socio-economic vulnerability with two models: an ANN and a Naive Bayes classifier.

Conclusion

The QualiFHIR FHIR infrastructure demonstrates how a standardized and secure data architecture can support data exchange between hospitals and enable the implementation of clinical decision support tools using AI models. These models have significant potential to improve the specific care of geriatric patients. The future of this project lies first in developing a dedicated application for geriatricians with the most effective model for each area on a larger patient cohort, then in the development of this infrastructure to other clinical contexts.
